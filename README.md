# Haptics-for-Texture-Identification--using-Prosthesis-
Project developed to address Haptics for Rehabilitation

In this project we explore a prototype that creates the illusion of feeling textures on the forearm when texture is detected by vibration sensors on a prosthetic.

Upper-limb prosthetic users have expressed strong emotional feelings associated with prosthesis prototypes that include sensory feedback. One amputee expressed this sentiment by saying, "I still believe that it is the fine sense of touch on the surface of the prosthesis that will make it a part of me. I often think of practical things but there it gets emotional, it really gets under my skin" [1]. Surgical interventions such as intraneural stimulation have demonstrated that it is possible to allow amputees to discriminate textures that promote a sense of ownership from an upper-limb prosthetic that detects and measures surface coarseness [2]. Others have also demonstrated that ownership can be induced without surgical intervention; for example, D’Alonzo et. al demonstrate with a rubber hand illusion in upper-limb amputees using vibrotactile motors [3].
